@RestController is a specialized version of the controller that incorporates the @Controller and @ResponseBody resulting in easier controller implementation as your methods no longer require the @ResponseBody before the return type in each method signature.

Example:

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class HelloController {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String hello() {
        return "Hello, World!";
    }
}

Notice that we no longer need the @ResponseBody annotation anywhere in the class.



@RestController helps with rapid development and ensuring that a response is always given to the users based on the HTTP requests they've given to the API such as logging in, requesting information, updating information, registering, etc.
