Spring Boot Actuator is a sub-project of the Spring Boot Framework that aims to assist you in monitoring and managing your application when it's pushed to production.

Key Features
End Points: Actuator provides several built-in endpoints (such as /health, /info, /metrics, etc.) for various monitoring purposes. Each one provides different insights into the application.

Health Check: It provides detailed health information about the application. This is beneficial in determining whether or not the application is running as expected.

Metrics Gathering: It collects and provides various metrics about the application, such as memory usage, garbage collection, web request statistics, and many more. These can be used to identify potential issues or bottlenecks.

Application Info: Provides detailed information about the application, such as version number, Git commit ID, and others.

Loggers: Actuator provides the ability to view and modify the log level of your application in real-time.

Auditing: It automatically audits events in your application and accesses it through the /auditevents endpoint.

HTTP Tracing: Provides trace information about the last 100 HTTP request-response exchanges via /trace endpoint.

Security
Actuator endpoints expose sensitive information of your application, so itâ€™s always recommended to secure your Actuator endpoints.

Spring Boot Actuator is an essential tool for monitoring and managing Spring Boot applications, making it a must-have tool for any serious Spring Boot developer.


Here are some real-world applications of Spring Boot Actuator:

Continuous Monitoring: Operations teams can continuously monitor the health of the application to identify any issues or failures quickly.
Integration with Monitoring Tools: Health checks provided by Spring Boot Actuator can be integrated with external monitoring tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or Datadog for comprehensive monitoring and alerting.
Performance Optimization: Developers can use metrics to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize critical parts of the application.
Capacity Planning: Operations teams can use metrics to plan for capacity upgrades based on trends in resource usage over time.
Debugging and Troubleshooting: Developers and operations teams can use logging endpoints to troubleshoot issues and debug problems in production.
Compliance and Security: Audit endpoints provide insights into application security and compliance by tracking changes and access to sensitive data.
Configuration Management: Operations teams can use environment information to manage application configurations dynamically without redeploying the application.
Troubleshooting Configuration Issues: Developers can use environment information to troubleshoot configuration-related issues in production environments.
Business-specific Monitoring: Developers can create custom endpoints to monitor business-specific metrics or gather domain-specific insights.
Operational Tasks: Operations teams can create custom endpoints to perform operational tasks such as cache eviction, database cleanup, or system diagnostics.

This is an example of setting up Spring Boot Actuator in a Spring Boot application and monitoring its basic endpoints. Let's say we have a Spring Boot project that has includes Spring Web and Spring Boot Actuator as dependencies.

Step 1: Enable Actuator Endpoints
Spring Boot Actuator endpoints are secured by default. To enable the endpoints, we need to add the following configuration to the application.properties file:

management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*
This configuration will expose all actuator endpoints. However, exposing all endpoints can pose a security risk, as some of them can reveal sensitive information. For the sake of this example and testing purposes, we're exposing all, but in a production application, you should expose only necessary endpoints.

Step 2: Access the Actuator Endpoints
Once the application is running, we can access the Actuator endpoints from the web browser or using a tool like Postman or curl.

The most basic endpoint is the /health endpoint, which shows the health status of the application. We can access it at:

http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
We should see a response similar to the following:

{
  "status": "UP"
}
Congratulations! We've successfully set up and tested a basic Spring Boot Actuator endpoint in your application. Remember that these endpoints are typically secured when deploying an application to a production environment.
