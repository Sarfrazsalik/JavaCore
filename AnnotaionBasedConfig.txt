The Spring Framework is a robust and versatile framework that's widely used in the Java ecosystem for creating enterprise-level applications. In Spring, the application configuration can be done either using XML or annotations. This document will focus on the annotation-based configuration.

Annotation-based configuration is another type of configuration that uses Component annotations only, such as @Component, @Service, @Repository, and @Controller for declaring beans, and @Autowired for Dependency Injection.

@Component is a general-purpose stereotype annotation indicating that the class is a Spring component.
@Service, @Repository, and @Controller are specializations of @Component for specific use cases.
@Autowired: It is used to achieve Dependency Injection. The Spring container auto-wires beans by looking at the classes in the classpath, matching them by type or by name.
Benefits of Annotation-Based Configuration:

Simplicity: Using annotations often leads to cleaner and more readable code as the metadata (annotations) are placed right next to the code they are related to.
Elimination of XML configuration: Annotations eliminate the need for XML configuration files, providing a means to move towards a zero-XML configuration. The XML files could get quite verbose and difficult to manage in large projects.
Improved productivity: With annotations, developers can avoid writing long XML configuration files and spend more time writing the business logic.
Type Safety: Since annotations are strongly typed, errors will be caught at compile time rather than at runtime, as could happen with string-based XML configurations.
Better for Collaboration and Control: With annotations, the configurations are done in the code, so it's easier for multiple team members to understand what's happening in the codebase and maintain version control.
Contextual Configuration:Annotations allow configurations to be applied right where they're needed, making the configuration context-specific and easier to understand.


Here are some real-world application types where annotation-based configuration in Spring is commonly used:

Web Applications: Annotation-based configuration in Spring is widely used in the development of web applications. This includes applications utilizing Spring MVC, where controllers can be easily configured using @Controller annotation and request mapping annotations like @RequestMapping, @GetMapping, etc.

Restful Services: In the development of RESTful web services using Spring Boot, annotations like @RestController and @RequestMapping are used for configuring endpoints.

Enterprise Applications: Annotation-based configurations are extensively used in larger enterprise level applications. Spring's @Service, @Repository and @Component annotations are used to denote service classes, data access objects (DAOs), and other Spring components respectively.



Below is a demonstration of defining Dependency Injection (DI) using annotation-based configuration with @Controller, @Service, and Repository annotations. We will have a Gallery entity and a basic controller-service-repository architecture in our application.

Step 1: Setup
To begin, we can set up a project in Java by utilizing the build tool of our choice, such as Maven or Gradle. We will incorporate the required Spring dependencies into the projects build file.

Example:

<dependencies>
    <!-- Other dependencies -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-context</artifactId>
        <version>5.3.9</version> <!-- Replace with the desired version -->
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
Step 2: Create Bean Classes
We need to identify the beans that need to be managed by the Spring container and create the corresponding bean classes:

Gallery class:

package com.example.annotationbased;

public class Gallery {

    // fields
    private Integer id;
    private String name;
    private String description;

    // ... other class members omitted
}
GalleryController class:

package com.example.annotationbased;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;

@Controller
public class GalleryController {
    
    private GalleryService galleryService;

    public GalleryController(GalleryService galleryService) {
        this.galleryService = galleryService;
    }
}
GalleryService class:

package com.example.annotationbased;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class GalleryService {
    
    private GalleryRepository galleryRepository;

    public void setGalleryService(GalleryRepository galleryRepository) {
        this.galleryRepository = galleryRepository;
    }
}
GalleryRepository class:

package com.example.annotationbased;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Repository;

@Repository
public class GalleryRepository {
    
}
Step 3: Application Entry Point
In the main method of our application's entry point class, we can create an instance of the Spring ApplicationContext and use it to get and use the beans:

package com.example.annotationbased;

import org.springframework.context.annotation.AnnotationConfigApplicationContext;

public class AnnotationBasedApplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// #1. create container and configure by specifying package to find beans in
		AnnotationConfigApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext("com.example.annotationbased");

		// #2. get and use beans
		String[] allBeanNames = context.getBeanDefinitionNames();
		System.out.println("\nBeans created involving annotation-only config:");
		for (String beanName : allBeanNames) {
			System.out.println(beanName);
		}

		// #4. close container
		((AnnotationConfigApplicationContext) context).close();
	}

}
In this example, we created a container that manages beans for the package all of our sources files are within, the com.example.annotationbased package.

Step 4: Run the Application
Now we can run the application to verify that the beans are created and dependencies are injected correctly. Output:
Beans created involving annotation-only config:
org.springframework.context.annotation.internalConfigurationAnnotationProcessor
org.springframework.context.annotation.internalAutowiredAnnotationProcessor
org.springframework.context.event.internalEventListenerProcessor
org.springframework.context.event.internalEventListenerFactory
galleryController
galleryRepository
galleryService
By following these steps and customizing the code according to your specific requirements, you can successfully incorporate Dependency Injection using annotation-based configuration.
